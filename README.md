## Development

Useful Gulp tasks:

`gulp pack` - Rebuilds the output ZIP package that contains the code of the Lambda function, and can be uploaded to AWS.

`gulp pack:incremental` - Recompiles the TypeScript files and rebuilds the output ZIP package, using the previously downloaded Node modules in the output folder.
